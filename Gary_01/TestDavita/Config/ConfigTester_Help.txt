Test File Format:
### ╔════════════════════════════════╦═════════════════════════╦═══════════════════════╦════════════════════════════════════════╦══════════════════════════╗
### ║[URL/XPath/CssSelector/TagName] ; [Action/Expected value] ; [Element Lookup Type] ; [Perform Action other than Read Value] ; [Critical Assertion]     ║
### ╚════════════════════════════════╩═════════════════════════╩═══════════════════════╩════════════════════════════════════════╩══════════════════════════╝
### Each parameter is separate by a semi-colon to prevent interference with navigation urls and colons
### The first parameter url to navigate to, xPath, CssSelector, Tag Name, ClassName, ID
### The second parameter action to take or expected value to retrieve for URLs both are required separated by a space then alt(206),
###     ╬ then space. ' ╬ '  optionally add a second space alt(206) space delimiter to add a time delay (thread sleep value in milliseconds) to give the event time to complete.
###     The format is: Action ╬ Expected Value ╬ Time delay before making the assertion
### The third parameter is the type of check to perform and will be ignored for performing Navigation where that is irrelevant
###        acceptable values are xPath, CssSelector, Tag Name, ClassName, ID and n/a
### The fourth parameter is the PerformAction boolean and true when text should be entered, a click occurs, a wait, or Navigating and false when reading element values
### The fifth parameter is the IsCrucial boolean.  When true, if the assertion fails the test stops immediately.  When false, if the assertion fails, the tests continue.

The examples below are are not all inclusive but rather attempt to provide you with a basic understanding so that you can make the necessary changes to accomplish the task.
When an error occurs, usually an element not found error, a screenshot will automatically be taken.

All Navigation steps should be marked as crucial, as all subsequent checks require that navigation to complete successfully!!!
To Navigate and mark that step as crucial
╠https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_ref_comp_dropdown-menu&stacked=h ; Navigate ; n/a ; true ; true╣

To Navigate, assert that the URL is what follows the ╬ character and to wait 4 seconds before making the assertion to allow the page to load:
╠https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/form ; Navigate ╬ https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/form ╬ 4000 ; n/a ; true ; true╣

To check a URL without navigating and to make it non-curcial.  To make it crucial change the last parameter to true.
╠n/a ; URL ╬ https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/thanks ; n/a ; true ; false╣

To wait for a specific amount of time before continuing for page loading or script completion
To wait for 5 seconds before continuing onto the next step.
╠n/a ; Wait ╬ 5000 ; n/a ; true ; false╣

To fill in a field by ID and to make it non-crucial.  To make it crucial change the last parameter to true.
╠first-name ; John ; ID ; true ; false╣


Retrieving text is usually non-crucial and test execution can usually continue so the following examples are all non-crucial.  Update based on your requirements.
To retrieve the text of an element by ClassName and make the assertion non-crucial
╠alert ; The form was successfully submitted! ; ClassName ; false ; false╣

To retrieve the text of an element by xPath
╠/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[1]/div[1]/div[1]/h1[1] ; Empower Yourself with Kidney Knowledge ; xPath ; false ; false╣

When you are attempting to access an element in an iFrame, you must first switch to that iframe.
The syntax for doing so is placed in the second parameter using the key phrase Switch to iframe 
followed by the name in square brackets as shown in the following example.
To retrieve the text of an element in an iFrame by xPath
╠/html/body/select ; Switch to iframe [iframeResult] ╬ Volvo ; xPath ; false ; false╣

To click an element by ID
╠checkbox-2 ; click ; ID ; true ; false╣

To click an element by xPath
╠/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/h4[3] ; click ╬ https://www.davita.com/education ╬ 5000 ; xPath ; true ; false╣

To click an element by xPath in an iFrame
╠/html/body/div/div/ul/li[1]/a ; Switch to iframe [iframeResult] ╬ click ; xPath ; true ; true╣

To select an option from an HTML Select (drop down/list) element.
╠option[value='1'] ; click ; CssSelector ; true ; false╣

To take a screen shot/print screen.  The browser will be resized automatically to capture all page content.
╠n/a ; ScreenShot ; n/a ; true ; false╣
