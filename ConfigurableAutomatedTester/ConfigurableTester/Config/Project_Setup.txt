Currently, there are two separate Projects as part of this application.
THE INITIAL PROJECT:
	The initial project used ANSI delimiters along with spaces and semi-colons in the test file while using two forward slashes in the Configuration file
	and became quite complex to understand and explain to others.
	To use the initial project, be sure to update the HomePage.java file below and reverse the commented calls in the Form.Java.
	Run the TestHomePage() method using JUnit to run this part of the application. 

THE UPDATED PROJECT:  (Default currently setup to run.)
	The Updated Project uses XML to describe the configuration file and the Test Settings files.  
	This uniform approach allows for easier understanding because there is a common template for constructing both file types.
	This project has more functionality than the initial project such as Sql Server connectivity and querying.
	To use the updated project, be sure to update the TestCentral.java file below. 
	Run the ConfigurableTestController() method using JUnit to run this part of the application.

FOR BOTH PROJECTS PARTS:
	1. 	First, open the TestCentral.java and HomePage.java files and update hardcoded paths for the config file, 
		log file, as well as the paths for the Chrome, Firefox and PhantomJs drivers.

	2.	Second, mark the Pages, test and Entities folders as Sources Root folders.

	3.	Third, make sure that your java version is 1.8 so that you can compile.

	4. 	Optionally, you may choose to change the default name and or path of the Configuration file, the log file or the help file, 
		all of which can be changed in the 

FOR SETTING UP A NEW PROJECT:
	1. 	Create the configuration file.  
		Two configuration files are part of this project and can be found in the Config project folder.
		It is suggested that you make a backup of these files to ensure that you do not lose the structure.
		For the Updated Project: ConfigurationSetup.xml
		For the Legacy Project: ConfigurationSetup.tconfig
		



New things to implement:
Writing the test results in a readable 

Change configuration file name to ConfigurationSetup.(txt|tscript)
Option to select a folder where test files are instead of individual files - 
	Possibly numbering files for run order
	Sort files when taken in
