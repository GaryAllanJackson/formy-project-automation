WELCOME TO THE CONFIGURABLE AUTOMATED TEST APPLICATION!!!
This application was designed to perform automated testing using configuration and test step files.
It was intended to remove the need for per project automated test coding, but grew out of the curiosity to 
learn more about headless testing with Java and Selenium.

This can be run as a stand-alone application or as a JUnit test within the IDE, as it was frequently run within IntelliJ.
	Colors and other special ANSI characters are removed from the Stand-alone application as they are unsupported
	outside of the IDE.
Working as a stand-alone application allows this to be scheduled to run whenever it is desired by either creating a Scheduled Task
or using some other automated process tool, or writing one of your own.
Running outside of the IDE means that it can be quickly executed without opening the IDE and then the source project.
The Log file name will be preceded with "StandAlone_" when run as a stand-alone application.
By default, log and CSV files will be created in the "\Config" folder, which is part of this project.
The log file records all test steps performed as well as the success and fail status of assertion steps which include steps that
compare a value to a supplied expected value.
The CSV file records only success and fail status steps but none of the supporting steps surrounding those checks.
Look at the Project_Setup.txt file for directions on running the stand-alone application as part of a batch file.

The application covers most testing, including: Navigation, Form Population, Value checking, Value Persistence for use in 
upcoming test step comparisons or form populations, context menu access, iFrame access, switching  browser tabs, 
SQL Server Connectivity and Querying, anchor href and text property checking, image src and alt property
checking, checking color contrast, conditional block to run tests only if a condition step passes,
and unique value generation so that form population tests can be run over and over using this value to 
ensure that entry is unique each time.

Additionally, it includes waiting a specific length of time, for document state complete, for a specific element, 
taking screenshots and comparing images using ImageMagick and getting a pixel difference percentage along with a.
difference image with the differences highlighted.
In addition to Conditional Blocks, each step can be marked as Crucial or non-Crucial.
Crucial test steps must pass or the application terminates on failure, while non-Crucial steps
can fail and the application will continue running tests.
This behavior ensures that necessary steps for subsequent testing are successful such as navigation, connecting to SQL Server
retrieving JSON from an endpoint etc...  If these steps fail, the subsequent tests reliant upon them will also fail but to avoid
wasting time waiting for those steps to fail, marking these steps as crucial stops execution when they fail and the tester
can see where the application terminated and perform further investigation.
An added test step configuration can be used to create a test step file for a specific page and while this is not a test,
it can make creating test files much faster.

Creating a Configurable Automated test consists of creating one Configuration file and one or more Test files.
This application can run any number of Test Files, which need to be configured in the Configuration file either
individually or within a specified folder which can be filtered to select just targeted files.

**********[ IMPORTANT NOTES ]***********************************************************************
NOTE: Test Steps are numbered by File underscore then Test Step.
	The F describes the Test File being run while the S describes the Test Step being run.
	Test Files and Test Steps begin at 0, so F0_S0 is the first Test File and the first Test Step in that file.
NOTE: The != operator is currently only supported for the following commands: Assert, Sql Server Query, Check Count.
	There was no viable use case for implementing this functionality for other commands 
	and the reason it is not supported in the JSON query is explained in the JSON Query section.

NOTE: For most verifiable operations the success or failure output will be left aligned, regardless of the margin of the 
	process it is reporting on.
	This was done purposely so that the results are easy to find and always begin with Success or Failure.
	Additionally, in the console, Successful results are displayed in green, while Failure results are displayed in Red.
	Any item appear in the console in Red means that either the item failed or it was configured improperly or an important item
	was not configured at all.
	LOOK AT ALL ITEMS IN RED AND MAKE UPDATES ACCORDINGLY!!!
****************************************************************************************************

This help file is broken up into 4 separate sections:

	1.	HELP FILE OVERVIEW - This is that section and it is intended to provide an overview of the application and this help file.

	2.	CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT  - Describes the format of the configuration file and details the use and settings of each field.
		Two example configurations are provided to showcase two different means of configuring the way test files are specified.

	3.	TEST FILE FORMAT - Describes the format of the test file(s) and details the use and settings of each field.
		Various examples and alternate steps are outlined describing the test settings necessary to perform each test function.

	4.	INCLUDED TEST FILES - this section describes the test files that have been included with this application in the Tests folder.
	5.	TROUBLESHOOTING - describes common issues and how to address them to get the desired results.

Future functionality to be added to this application:
	Greater Than and Less Than Operator.
		-	This could be a good addition when used with Conditional Blocks.
		-	Currently, only validatable(read actionType) commands can be used for the conditional statement such as an text, src, alt or
				href assertion or element found.

	Color Contrast code has been implemented to allow for color contrast checking using this page's formula.
		-	https://www.w3.org/TR/AERT/#color-contrast
		-	Currently reviewing and comparing pages to determine whether to implement color contrast using this page:
		-	https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G17.html

	MongoDb Connectivity and Querying will be implemented.
		-	This was partially implemented but abandoned for a later time when there is access to a MongoDB instance.

	Continuous Total Command
		-	This would allow for adding to a total throughout a singular test.
		-	This functionality would be ideal for spreadsheet interactions where values from different cells are retrieved and totaled.

NOTES: The file format is XML, so to make comments use <!-- to begin the comment and --> to end the comment.
Comments can span lines but comments cannot include other comment blocks.
Comments are lightly sprinkled in some of the help XML examples below.

THIS APPLICATION IGNORES ALL COMMENTS.
COMMENTS ARE FOR THE USER.

Some of the comments are descriptive and some show alternative options, but it is suggested that you read the help file
to best understand how to use this Configurable Automated Testing Application.
Refer to an XML guide for proper commenting.  Google it!!!!
Both configuration file examples can be used as starting points, just substitute values accordingly.
The terms element and node may be used interchangeably below to refer to the same thing.
The following is an example of a configuration file which will be explained below.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

	<!-- Folder where test files are located -->
	<testFolderName></testFolderName>
	<!-- Folder filter type valid values are [Starts With], [Contains] and [Ends With] without the brackets -->
	<folderFileFilterType></folderFileFilterType>
	<!-- Folder filter is the text used to select a subset of files -->
	<folderFileFilter></folderFileFilter>
</automatedTestConfiguration>

The first line is an XML file declaration and must be present as is.
All elements are required but not all elements have to have a value.  Read on.
The <automatedTestConfiguration> is the root element in which all configuration elements are contained.
	It contains no text itself.

<!-- folder where screenshots should be saved --> is a comment and was purposely included to demonstrate how to add comments.
	Comments were added to describe the function of the element that follows it.
	Subsequent comments will not be described.

The <screenShotSaveFolder></screenShotSaveFolder> element specifies the location where Screen Shots will be saved.
	This folder must already exist!

The <maxScreenShotsToTake></maxScreenShotsToTake> element specifies the maximum number of Screen Shots to take.
	This allows the user to understand any hard drive space limitations and prevent screenshots from eating up space.
	In the event that tests fail, this setting can be changed to try to target the issue with a screenshot if the 
	reported error is insufficient for troubleshooting thoroughly.
		-   When -1, no screen shots will be taken even if an error occurs.
		-   When 0, there is no limit and all screenshots will be taken.
		-   When any other number, that number of screenshots or less will be taken depending upon the test and the max value set.
		-   Errors like, Element not found, will create a screenshot to allow you to see the page the application was on when 
			the error occurred.

The <browserType></browserType> element specifies the type of browser to use when running the test(s).
	-Valid values are: Firefox, Chrome, PhantomJS

The <runHeadless></runHeadless> element specifies whether to run the test(s) in headless mode.
		-	This is a boolean field and can be true or false.  The case does not matter.
	Headless mode means that the browser does not display on-screen and is used with automation servers
	to allow running automated tests as part of the build process.
		-	PhantomJS always runs headless if selected regardless of the runHeadless setting.
		-	To watch the test, use Chrome or Firefox.
		-	If not specified, Chrome is the default and will be used.

The <testAllBrowsers></testAllBrowsers> element specifies whether the test(s) should run in all browsers or just the selected browser.
		-	This is a boolean field and can be true or false.  The case does not matter.
		-	If false, BrowserType must be set and only that browser will be used when running tests.
		-	If true, BrowserType is ignored and the program will cycle through all browsers.

The <specifyTestFiles></specifyTestFiles> element specifies whether or not the configuration file will list the test files to be used.
		-	This is a boolean field and can be true or false.  The case does not matter.
		-	If true, the files specified will be used in the order in which they are listed.
		-	If false, the files will be ignored as this indicates that the folder settings will be used instead.

The <sortSpecifiedTestFiles></sortSpecifiedTestFiles> element specifies whether or not to sort the test files.
	This setting made sense in the old system but makes much less sense now that files are physically listed numerically.
	The number no longer has meaning in the sort as each entry should be entered in numerical order, so the number will not be used for sorting.
		-	If false, files are taken in the order in which they are physically listed, which should be numerically.
		-	If true, files will be sorted alphabetically and re-listed on the screen to show the order in which they will execute.

The <createCsvStatusFiles></createCsvStatusFiles> element specifies whether to create none, one, or many CSV files.
	The CSV file logs only Success, Failure and Error steps, unlike the Test Execution log file, which logs all test steps.
	This setting has 3 acceptable values "none", "one" and "many".
		-	If "none", which is the default, no CSV files will be produced.
		-	If "one", one CSV file containing all tests run results, will be produced and it will be named similar to the corresponding
			-	log file name but have a .csv extension.
		-	If "many", one CSV file for each test will be produced and each will be named similar to the corresponding test file name 
			-	but have a datetime stamp like the log file and with a .csv extension.
		-	If any value other than those specified above, no CSV files will be produced.
	The CSV file consists of the following 5 columns:
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		| File And Step Number | Test Performed | Execution Status | Variable Output | Test File Name    |
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		| F0_S0                | Navigation ... | Successful       | (2.0)           | C:\....\...       |
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		File and Step Number - This column displays the file number and step number, each starting at 0 and in the format F0_S0 where 
		-	F0 corresponds to File 0, which is the first file, and S0 corresponds to Step 0, which is the first step.
		-	Since all steps taken are not checks, there may be line number gaps.
		Test Performed - This column displays a description of the test performed such as Navigation and URL Check, 
		-	Equal comparison results etc..
		Execution Status - This column displays the word Successful for successful test step checks and the word Failure for failed test step checks.
		Variable Output - This column holds the difference percentage for image comparisons in percentage format like 28%, 
		-	the http response code in square brackets like [200], element counts in numeric format like 128 
		-	and calculations in parentheses like (2.0) or (2) to allow for filtering these separate check types easily.
		Test File Name - This column holds the name of the test file this entry corresponds with.
		-	When creating one CSV file for multiple tests, this allows for another method of sorting the data.

The <testFiles></testFiles> element is a container element for the testFileName elements and has no textual content of its own.

The <testFileName1></testFileName1> element specifies the test file to use for the test and each element should end with an incremental numeric value.
	Example:
		<testFileName1></testFileName1>
		<testFileName2></testFileName2>

	It should be noted that while this ending numeric value should be incremental, the application will read all 
	testFileName nodes in the order they are entered regardless of the numbering.
	To avoid any possible issues related to this, it is suggested that you follow the best practice and number appropriately, as described.
	The commented test file lines were included to show a means in which different files can be setup but can be commented so that only 
	the intended test files run.

---------------------[ Start of Grouped Configuration Settings ]-------------------
The following three settings need to be talked about together since they work together to provide a particularly useful piece of functionality.
Together, the following settings allow for filtering a particular folder for the files used for testing.
If a common naming convention is used for test files that include the project name, these settings allow for running 
Just one Project's test files, just some of a Project's test files or just one test file in a project or one type of test file across 
	all test projects.

The <testFolderName></testFolderName> element specifies the folder where test files are located to allow for reading a folder of 
	test files instead of naming each test file individually.

The <folderFileFilterType></folderFileFilterType> element specifies the type of filtering to perform on the files in the folder.  Options are: 
	-	[Starts With], [Contains] and [Ends With] 
		-	[Starts With] - will select only the test files starting with the filter entered
		-	[Contains] - will select only test files containing the filter entered
		-	[Ends With] - will select only test files ending with the filter entered

The <folderFileFilter></folderFileFilter> element specifies the phrase to use to when selecting files in the specified folder.

	When used with the other folder settings, a folder containing a multitude of test files can be pointed to using the 
	-	<testFolderName></testFolderName> element.
	Then, using the <folderFileFilterType></folderFileFilterType> element, [Starts With] can be used to return only files starting with a 
	-	specific value.
	Finally, using the <folderFileFilter></folderFileFilter> element, a phrase like the project name can be used to select only files in the 
	-	selected folder that start with the project name.
---------------------[ End of Grouped Configuration Settings ]-------------------

In the example configuration file provided above the explanations, two specific test files are being tested, the screen shot folder is specified, 
a maximum of 5 screenshots will be taken, only the test Chrome browser will be used and it will be visible, the files will be run in the
order entered, the TestFolderName, FolderFileFilterType and FolderFileFilter have not been specified but would have been disregarded
if specified because <specifyTestFiles></specifyTestFiles> is true, meaning only files specifically specified will be used.
The commented test file lines were included to show a means in which different files can be setup but can be commented so that only

In the example configuration file provided below, a folder of test files are being tested, but only the files that contain the phrase "sql"
will be used, the screen shot folder is specified, but no screenshots will be taken, only the Chrome browser will be used and it will be visible,
and although test files are specified, they will be ignored because <specifyTestFiles></specifyTestFiles> is false meaning the folder
settings will be used to determine the test files to be used.
Additionally, no CSV files will be created because the <createCsvStatusFiles></createCsvStatusFiles> is set to "none".

═════════[ TEST FILE OVERVIEW ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Test file is an xml file, that can include comments just like any xml file.
A test file can consist of one or more test steps and there are currently no known limitations as some tests have contained
tens of thousands of steps.
The drawback to having large test files is that at some point the display will cut off older messages, and the log file will be the 
only way to track the status of all test steps.
Below, there are compound commands that allow for completing a step without creating a separate Navigation step.
While this functionality was added for convenience, we strongly suggest using the separate Navigation step and making it crucial 
as will be explained later.
The test file allows for:
1.	Certain steps to be a point of failure for the entire test if it fails to prevent dependant steps from 
  	attempting to execute if the prerequisite step fails, such as Navigation, Establishing a Database connection or Getting JSON from an endpoint.
2.	Certain steps to be decisional so that steps based on the success of the prerequesite step only execute if 
  	the prerequisite step is successful, otherwise dependent steps are skipped and steps subsequent to this block are executed.
3. Comments to be plentiful.  Comments can be used to document, or to comment out steps or step values for quickly switching
  	between different values when running tests over and over to try to track down a specific behavior.
4.	Test files are run one after another and most objects are scoped to just the test that required them so
  	Persisted Values, JSON object and SQL Connection object will all be reset and the Unique Identifiers will be reinitialized to a new value.

═════════[ TEST FILE FIELDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
It begins with the XML declaration followed by the <testSteps> root element.
Each test is grouped in <step> elements, which consist of the all or some of the following nodes:

<command>Command to execute</command> - The command node, describes the command to execute and is always required.

<actionType>read/write</actionType> - The actionType node can be set to read or write describing this as a read or write action.

	Assertions where an element value is being checked against a supplied value is a read.
	Navigation, clicking, populating text boxes, selecting select options, accessing context menu etc.. 
		are write actionTypes because they are performing an action rather than just reading a value.  
<accessor>select-menu</accessor> - The element identifier.

<accessorType>ID</accessorType> - The type of element identifier. (xPath, ClassName, CssSelector, Id, TagName)

<expectedValue>What you expect to retrieve</expectedValue> - The optional expectedValue node, if present, 
	acts as the expected value of the element value being retrieved as the actual value.

<crucial>TRUE</crucial> - The crucial node can be set to True or False and determines if testing should stop 
	or proceed if the step fails.  Set to True for stop and False for proceed.

<conditional>true</conditional> - The conditional node is used to start a conditional block of steps.
	All steps within the block depend upon the success of this step being successful.
	The Condition node should only ever be used when starting a conditional block of steps.
	A separate command is used to end the conditional block, so setting this to false is useless
	This can only be used on read actionTypes as performing an action is not verifiable.
	When applied if successful, all subsequent steps within the block will execute along with all steps after the block.
	When applied and unsuccessful for any reason, all subsequent steps within the block will be skipped
	 and all steps after the block will execute.

<arguments></arguments> - The arguments node is a container of numbered argument nodes.
	Argument order is crucial and out of order arguments can have unpredictable results.
	See the help sections below to learn the order of arguments for each command type.
<arg1>First argument</arg1> The numbered arguments vary greatly depending upon the type of command.
	<arg2>Second argument</arg2>
	<arg3>Third argument</arg3>
	Generally speaking, these numbered arguments are arranged so that the most relevant pieces of information 
	are the first items and the less relevant pieces of information are last.
	The order of the arguments is crucial, while properly numbering is important but improperly numbering is forgivable as long as the xml is valid.

There are few, if any, examples that use all nodes, so in the Navigation example below note that this does not use 
Accessor and AccessorType nodes because it accesses the URL instead of a page element when making an assertion. 
Also, keep in mind that while this represents the structure of a test file, it consists of only one of many possible test steps.

Usually, the test file will consist of multiple steps like (navigation, check element values(multiple steps) click element...etc...

═════════[ NAVIGATION ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Navigation command navigates the browser to the provided URL.
All Navigation steps should be marked as crucial, as all subsequent checks require that navigation complete successfully!!!
An assertion does not have to be part of navigation, but it probably should be!!!
As some testers may like to separate test steps, this is not enforced by the application and since a tester could choose to
navigate to separate pages in one test script and make a subsequent "URL without Navigation checks" conditional, there are 
sound alternatives to the suggested approach.
If Backend and Frontend timings are being tested, the URL must be tested, so the expected value must contain the URL 
if testing page timings.
To navigate without checking the URL, remove the expectedValue node completely as displayed in the example below.
For the Navigation command only, although the arguments should be in the order shown, if they 
are out of order the application will attempt to discern the order and rearrange them.
The Navigation command has 4 possible arguments but only the first argument is required.
The required first argument, <arg1></arg1>, contains the URL to be loaded.
The optional second argument, <arg2></arg2>, contains the time in milliseconds to wait to allow the page to load. 
 -  The default is 10 seconds.
The optional third argument, <arg3></arg3>, contains the dimensions for setting the browser window height and width.
The optional fourth argument, <arg4></arg4>, contains the maximum time in seconds for the  Back-End and Front-End  to load.
 - This last optional argument actually performs a test based on the values entered and reports if the Back-End and Front-End load 
 - times were within the maximum allotted time provided.
 - Individual times are displayed in Green, when within the allotted time, and in Red, when outside the allotted time.
 - This check is not part of the Crucial or Conditional functionality and will only display results but never determine
 - subsequent functionality.

To Navigate, without checking the URL to ensure that navigation occurred properly, to wait 4000 milli-seconds 
and to set the window dimensions to (800 x 800).
Please note that making this crucial is irrelevant as no assertions will be made.

═════════[ NAVIGATION WITH AUTHENTICATION WITH AND WITHOUT NAVIGATION CONFIRMATION ]═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Navigate command can be used to authenticate while navigating.
This is done by passing the username and password as part of the url delimited by a : and ending with the @ symbol.
It should be mentioned that this does not work for all authentication which is why there are different authentication methods.
Additionally, it should be mentioned that the Authentication and Login commands are not for form based authentication but 
rather for alert style login popups.
For logging into a page that has two input text type form fields, use the send keys command coupled with the click command.
To Navigate and Authenticate with username and password and assert that the URL is in the expectedValue node and to wait
4 thousand milli-seconds 
before making the assertion to allow the page to load:

This command is intended for sites that have alert style popup login forms.
There may be instances in which one or more Login/Authentication commands do not work
on a particular operating system, like iOs.
A mixed approach may work, but there is no guarantee.
Although the login command is a compound command there are instances in which 
having it work in this manner actually makes a difference over separate steps.

The Check URL command allows for checking the current page's URL without the need to navigate.
When an command, like a button or link click occurs that navigates to a new page, there is no need to
perform a navigation command but there is a need to check that the page is where expected before further testing.
NOTE: The <actionType></actionType> for this command is write, not a read.
This command is designed to work with event navigation to ensure that the navigation has occurred prior to subsequent testing.

═════════[ SWITCHING TO AN IFRAME ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IMPORTANT: EACH TIME A SWITCH TO IFRAME COMMAND IS ISSUED, THE CONTEXT IS REVERTED TO THE MAIN WINDOW
ONCE THAT COMMAND COMPLETES EXECUTION, SO IF SUBSEQUENT TESTS NEED TO ACCESS THE IFRAME, THEY MUST BE
ENCAPSULATED WITHIN SWITCH TO IFRAME COMMANDS.
The Switch to iFrame command temporarily switches the current context to the iFrame mentioned in the firs argument.
Since only the command and first argument are needed to switch to the iFrame, the remaining test step elements
can be used to perform the desired action within the iFrame.
The default action when switching to an iFrame is the Assert, which checks the text of an element against the expected
value provided, so the assert command need not be used but any other commands should be placed into <arg2></arg2>.
Commands that can be used in the iFrame are assert, sendkeys, click, right click, double click, persist values and  check against persisted values.
A navigation event cannot be directed to take place in an iFrame.
If the arguments are not in the proper order, depending upon the command being performed in the iFrame, an attempt to reorder
the arguments will be made.  Unfortunately, some commands can be quite complex and interpreting arguments for reordering can be
even more complex, therefore, a message will be displayed indicating that the arguments are out of order so that they can be corrected
by the tester in the test steps file.
Failing to do so for complex commands may yield unexpected results.
The following example is an example of switching to an iFrame, specified in <arg1></arg1> and performing an assert
to check the element text pointed to by the <accessor></accessor> and <accessorType></accessorType> against the
expected value provided in the <expectedValue></expectedValue> element and since <crucial></crucial> is false
the status will be reported and subsequent tests will run regardless.
Specifically, the test is switching to the iframeResult iFrame, and checking the element specified for the text Tutorial.
<step>
	<command>Switch to iFrame</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<expectedValue>Tutorials</expectedValue>
	<crucial>false</crucial>
	<accessor>//button[contains(@id,'menu1')]</accessor>
	<accessorType>xPath</accessorType>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>iframeResult</arg1>
	</arguments>
</step>

To switch to an iFrame and perform a click, refer to the following example.
Note that you have to specify the command in <arg2></arg2> as click is not the default action.
<step>
	<command>Switch to iFrame</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>false</crucial>
	<accessor>//button[contains(@id,'menu1')]</accessor>

═════════[ CONDITIONAL BLOCKS ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IMPORTANT: CONDITIONAL BLOCKS CAN NOT BE NESTED!!!!

Creating a conditional block is a two step process.
1.	First, the conditional block must be started by adding the <conditional>true</conditional> node to a 
		test step that has the actionType set to read (<actionType>read</actionType>).
		Only read actionTypes are allowed to begin a conditional block because read steps 
		are checked against an expected value and are validatable.
		Any test steps based on the success of this condition can be placed after the condition.
		An example of a conditional block start is shown below.
		This command will be discussed in detail later, but note the presence of the conditional field, 
		which signifies the start of a conditional block.
		Simply stated, the following command checks the element using the xPath accessor and validates that the text of that 
		element is the expectedValue, and if so, it is marked as successful and block statements will execute, else block
		statements will be skipped.
<step>
	<command>assert</command>
	<conditional>true</conditional>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<expectedValue>FORMY</expectedValue>
	<crucial>FALSE</crucial>
	<accessor>/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/nav[1]/a[1]</accessor>
	<accessorType>xPath</accessorType>
</step>

1.	Second, the conditional block must be ended by adding an end condition command.
		The end conditional command node itself is the most important and only required
		 node of this test step, as shown below.
		This command neither reads nor writes and asserts nothing and therefore, cannot be marked as crucial.
		Once this command is executed, all remaining test steps will not longer dependent upon the condition
		and each will be executed as expected.
		If this command is not issued all steps after the start of the Conditional Block start will be considered
		part of the Conditional Block and will be executed or skipped accordingly.
The following is the End Conditional command used to end the Conditional Block.
<step>
	<command>end conditional</command>

Before explaining how to fill in text fields, we need to cover the Unique Identifier.
By default, every time a test is run, a unique identifier is created.
This unique identifier is composed of the date and time with no delimiters.
The purpose of this Unique Identifier is to allow rerunning the same tests and generating unique 
values by appending this Unique Identifier to the string, thus creating a unique data set each test run.
The Unique Identifier is 17 characters long and has the following format (yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS) ie.(20190402095619991).
 -  4 digit year, 2 digit month, 2 digit day, 2 digit hours, 2 digit minutes, 2 digit seconds, 3 digit milliseconds 
In the Filling in and SendKeys sections, there are examples of exactly how to use this.
Anytime, the character sequence without parenthesis (**_uid_**), is used, that value is replaced with the Unique Identifier.

═════════[ PERSISTING RETRIEVED TEXT IN A VARIABLE FOR LATER USE ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The PersistString command stores the element's text in memory for use later.
There may be a need to compare the value retrieved from one element with the value of another.
Unfortunately, this cannot be done directly, but a Persist action can be enacted allowing the storage of 
an element's value that can then be compared to the value of another element.
This accomplishes comparing one element value with another.
To persist the value of an element, use the following:
<step>
	<command>PersistString</command>
	<accessor>/html/body/div/h1</accessor>
	<accessorType>xPath</accessorType>
	<actionType>read</actionType>

Although the following can be found in the sendkeys section, in an effort to group all persistence in one 
location it is duplicated here.
There may be a need to send a persisted value to a control and that can be done as follows.
To send the persisted value to a textbox or textarea form control, use the following:

═════════[ TAKING SCREENSHOTS ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The ScreenShot command takes a screenshot of the current page.
To take a screen shot/print screen, the browser will be resized automatically to capture all page content,
if browser dimensions are not supplied; however, in the event that browser dimensions are supplied, the browser
will resize to the supplied dimensions.
The ability to resize the browser to specific dimensions allows for image pixel comparison as images being compared
must have the same width and height dimensions.
This command allows for overriding the configured screenshot folder and dynamic filename creation and either saving 
the images with a specified name in the configured screenshot folder or saving the images to a file naame and path 
specified as <arg1></arg1> but if <arg1></arg1> is not provided a name is constructed and the file is saved in the 
configured folder.
This command also allows for specifying the browser dimensions so that you get an image the exact size that you need.
Specifying the browser dimensions is the same as when navigating, where w= identifies the width value and h= identifies
the height value as shown here: <arg2>w=1400 h=1000</arg2>.
The ability to name the screenshot allows for executing subsequent Image Comparison steps and speficying the file names
based on the screenshots being taken.
In the following example, a default name will be provided for the  screenshot consisting of the browser used and the test step
where the command was called. (This is the default functionality.)
<step>
	<command>screenshot</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>false</crucial>
</step>

Alternatively, including the filename as an argument will allow you to save the Screenshot with the name of your choosing.
If a full path is included with the file name, and the folder structure exists, the screenshot will be saved to the location
provided, otherwise the screenshot will be saved to the configured screenshots folder with the file name provided.
In the following example, the screenshot will be saved to the configured screenshots folder with the file name provided.
This functionality allows for pointing to the file for subsequent image comparison.
<step>
	<command>screenshot</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>false</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>MyScreenShot.png</arg1>
	</arguments>
</step>

In the following example, the screenshot will be saved to the folder and file name provided.
This functionality allows for pointing to the file for subsequent image comparisons.
This is the preferred command structure when subsequently performing image comparisons.
This structure allows for separation of images into separate folders for quickly referencing differences.
<step>
	<command>screenshot</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>false</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>c:\myScreehShots\Actual\MyScreenShot.png</arg1>

═════════[ SWITCHING BROWSER TABS ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Right Click command can be used to access a link's context menu to open that link in a new tab and switch to that tab.
Some actions are related and to avoid unnecessary steps the enter key will be pressed after right clicking and arrowing to a particular item.
When running tests that access the context menu, the mouse and keyboard should not be used as they can change the context and cause the test to fail.
To Right click on an element, move down to the first menu item, click it to open in a new tab and switch to the new tab:
<step>
	<command>right click</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<accessor>//*[@id="block-menu-menu-dc-menu"]/div/div/ul/li[2]/a</accessor>
	<accessorType>xPath</accessorType>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>Keys.Arrow_Down</arg1>
		<arg2>Keys.Enter</arg2>
		<!-- the following line switches to the new tab, if this is the first new tab opened, for subsequent tabs used the switch to tab command -->
		<arg3>switch to tab</arg3>
	</arguments>
</step>

Alternatively, the steps can be separated into two separate steps where the 
context menu opens a new tab and then the next step switches to the second tab.
<step>
	<command>right click</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<accessor>//*[@id="block-menu-menu-dc-menu"]/div/div/ul/li[2]/a</accessor>
	<accessorType>xPath</accessorType>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>Keys.Arrow_Down</arg1>
		<arg2>Keys.Enter</arg2>
	</arguments>
</step>

The Switch To Tab command switches to another Tab but if Tab argument is not provided, switches back to the first(parent) tab.
When opening a new tab and using a separate Switch to Tab command, remember to use a wait between the commands to allow for the tab
to fully load before attempting to switch to it, or the number of tags will not be properly reported to the application and the 
Switch to Tab command will fail.
<step>
	<command>Switch to tab</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
</step>
Alternate Switch to tab command with the tab specified as an argument.
Recently updated, this method allows switching between all open tabs by passing the tab index as <arg1>.
The parent tab, where the test originated is tab 0, the first child is tab 1, etc...
If you open a tab from the parent and then open another tab from the parent, the first is tab 1 and the second is tab 2,
however, switching to child tabs and opening tabs between the current child and the last child may have unexpected results.
As a rule of thumb, open the tabs manually testing the layout of the tabs before attempting to automate this functionality.
The following command switches to the first child tab and is an alternate way of doing this separating the functionality from the
right click command allowing more granular control of switching between tabs.
<step>
	<command>Switch to tab</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>1</arg1>
	</arguments>
</step>

The following command switches to the second child tab.
<step>
	<command>Switch to tab</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>2</arg1>
	</arguments>
</step>

To Switch back to the first tab after switching to the second tab.
<step>
	<command>Switch to tab 0</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>0</arg1>
	</arguments>
</step>

An alternative to the above command allows the tab number argument to be excluded, as the default is tab 0 - the parent tab.
Note that this has no argument and is relying upon the default setting to return to the first tab.
<step>
	<command>Switch to tab 0</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>

═════════[ CLOSE ONE OR ALL OPEN TABS ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Close Child Tab command closes one or all child tabs but not the main tab
If the test that is being run opens multiple tabs, at some point before all tests end, there may be a need to close one or all open child tabs.
The most important reason to do this would be to avoid confusion as opening multiple tabs and keeping track of multiple tabs can become
quite complex, whereas, closing and opening new tabs may be far less complex.
Tabs are numbered 0 for main, 1 for first child(left most tab), 2 for second child etc...
The Close Child Tab command takes one optional argument which is the tab number.
If this optional argument is missing or set to the 0, which is the main tab, all child tabs are closed.
The following command closes the first child tab specified by the supplied argument.
<step>
	<command>Close Child tab</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<arguments>

═════════[ FIND ELEMENTS THAT HAVE SPECIFIC TEXT ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Find command finds elements that have the supplied text.
There are times when you may need to search for text but do not know the accessor necessary to find that text.
The Find functionality allows you search all elements regardless of type or just all tags of a specific type for a phrase.
Additionally, the Find functionality returns the xPath of all elements where the text is found, but when searching 
for text without specifying a tag, only the actual tag containing the text is returned, not elements in the upper 
hierarchy; however, when using a specific tag, if a child tag of that tag contains the text, the searched tag will be returned 
as successfully containing that text. 
To Find text searching all elements and make this non-crucial, use the following.
<step>
	<command>find</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<expectedValue>Highest level of education</expectedValue>
	<crucial>FALSE</crucial>
</step>

═════════[ FIND ELEMENTS THAT CONTAIN TEXT ]═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
There are times when you may need to search for a portion of text but do not know the accessor necessary to find that text.
A specific instance might be when searching for text that would be in a paragraph.
You wouldn't want to add the entire paragraph when you can add a snippet to verify that part of it is there.
Additionally, the Find functionality returns the xPath of all elements where the text is found.
To Find element containing text searching all div elements and make this non-crucial, use the following.
<step>
	<command>find</command>

═════════[ CREATE TEST PAGE COMMAND TO CREATE PAGE TESTS OR FOR PROVIDING DATA TO HELP CREATE TESTS ]══════════════════════════════════════════════════
IMPORTANT NOTE #1: ANY PARENT ELEMENT WILL CONTAIN THE TEXT OF IT'S CHILD ELEMENT(s) SO TO GET THE ELEMENT THAT ACTUALLY 
			CONTAINS THE INFORMATION DESIRED, TRY TO ELIMINATE THE HIERARCHICAL ITEMS ABOVE THAT ARE NOT DESIRED, 
			LIKE CONTAINER ELEMENTS.  Examples include (html,head,body,div,table)
IMPORTANT NOTE #2: ENSURE THAT YOUR FILE PATH DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY KEYWORD USED FOR ANY OTHER ACTION, OR YOU WILL GET UNEXPECTED RESULTS!!!
  A test file needs to be created and you would like to spare yourself the hassle of looking up elements, associated properties and attributes.
  This may be especially helpful in the early stages of testing where with development and content updates, test step updates can occur but this
  process can quickly get the initial test steps created.
  To do this, create a test script, with a Navigate command, to Navigate to the page to be tested and then use the 
  create_test_page command or the create_test_page_formatted command.
  The create_test_page command outputs key value information so that a determination can be made to as to whether an item should be tested and 
  it provides all of the information to create the test command but it is not formatted as a test command.
  The create_test_page_formatted command outputs the element information in a test command format allowing for quick copy and paste to a test file.
  Both files indicate if an element is visible, if an a tag is acting as an anchor or a link.
  The Formatted File, will create tests for a tags that check text and href, for images that check src, for text fields it create tests that 
	 compare text provided with the element text, for text input it creates a sendkeys, for buttons, checkboxes and radio buttons it creates
	 a click, and for selects it creates a select command, allowing the user to enter one of the option values that is to be selected.
  The create_test_page command and the create_test_page_formatted command take the following test parameters:
   - arg1 is the Tag Type.  Use * for all tags, or div for just div tags etc...
		 -    Element Type: A single element with * being all elements and the default if left empty.
			 -   Elements Include but are not limited to: *, html, head, title, body, a, ol, ul, li, select, input etc...
			 -   If omitted, this will be * for all elements.
   - arg2 is the File where the Tags will be written.
		 -    File Path and File Name: This is where the results will be written.
			 -   If omitted, this will be written to the config folder. (/config/newTestFile.txt)
   - arg3 is the comma delimited list of Tags to exclude.
		 -    A comma delimited list of elements to skip when retrieving all element (*) information.
			 -   These would usually be elements that do not have text themselves but contain elements that do have text.
			 -   Do not include spaces between elements, just a comma as follows: html,head,title,body,div
			 -   Skip elements are ONLY APPLIED WHEN RETRIEVING ALL ELEMENTS and IGNORED WHEN RETRIEVING A SPECIFIC TAG TYPE.
  The following examples get all page elements except those container elements listed to skip, save them to a file, 
  and create test step XML files that can be used immediately.
<step>
	<command>create_test_page_formatted</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<arguments>

		<arg3>html,head,title,meta,script,body,style,nav,br,div,form</arg3>
	</arguments>
</step>


The following example gets all anchor tag elements, saves them to a file, and ignores the skips list because all elements are not being retrieved.
<step>
	<command>create_test_page_formatted</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<arguments>

		<arg3>html,head,title,meta,script,body,style,nav,br,div,form</arg3>
	</arguments>
</step>

The following example is the correct equivalent of the previous command.
<step>
	<command>create_test_page_formatted</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>a</arg1>
		<arg2>C:\Tests\TestPages\TestFileOutput_A_Only.txt</arg2>
	</arguments>
</step>
  Alternatively, for checking content or for manually creating tests, using the unformatted command may prove more useful.
  This command works just like the formatted command except it simply lists the element information, but does not make test steps.
  Example of some element information: Element Type, xPath, Text, Href, Src, Alt, Visibility.
  This file type is a plain text file and should be output accordingly.
  The following example creates an unformatted file(arg2) listing the described element attributes for all elements (arg1)
  except those in the skipped list (arg3)

	<command>create_test_page</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>

═════════[ CONNECT TO SQL SERVER DATABASE AND CLOSE THE CONNECTION ]═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Connect To Database command opens and persists a connection object until it is closed.
There will be times during the course of QA'ing a site where querying the database can confirm that a value has been 
added or removed.
NOTE: ALTHOUGH MONGODB IS MENTIONED IN THE COMMENTS BELOW, IT IS NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED.
AT THIS TIME ONLY SQL SERVER CONNECTIVITY IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED!!!
IMPORTANT: ENSURE THAT YOU ALWAYS CREATE A CLOSE CONNECTION TEST STEP TO CLOSE THE CONNECTION YOU OPEN!!!!
An emergency clean up process will attempt to shut down any open connections, but it is recommended that 
you do this with a test step to ensure that connection limits are not exhausted.
To do this, you must first establish a connection to the database and this is how to do that.
There are two ways to establish a connection to Sql Server.
<step>
	<!-- Open Connection to Sql Server -->
	<!-- Allows you to connect to a SQL Server database.  Make this step crucial or conditional as subsequent steps depend on it's success. -->

═════════[ CLOSING THE DATABASE CONNECTION ]═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Close Database Connection command closes an open database connection and destroys the connection object releasing the resource.
Equally important as opening the database connection object, is closing the database connection object.
Open connections consume resources and unclosed connections can use up all available memory or an 
allotment of connections depending on where the connection lives.
To avoid this, always write a close connection command whenever writing an open connection command.
While a cleanup method exists to close any open connections it should not be relied upon to close your open connection and
by the time it is executed, used resources could bog down the computer system depending upon what is being tested and what other
applications are open.
The close command is simple and as follows:
<step>
	<command>Close Database Connection</command>
	<actionType>write</actionType>
	<crucial>TRUE</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<arg1>SQL Server</arg1>

═════════[ QUERYING THE SQL SERVER DATABASE  ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Sql Server Query command executes a Sql Server Query for a single field value and compares that to the expected value.
When testing a site, there sometimes needs to be verification that a value was 
actually written to, or removed from the database.  
This is the purpose of the Sql Server Query Command.
There are two ways to query the database.
First option: Specify the Table, Field and Where clause separately.
The last argument is the comparison type and must be included for != test steps, 
but is optional for = test steps.
<step>
	<command>Sql Server Query</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<expectedValue>General</expectedValue>
	<crucial>false</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<!-- Table to query or select statement -->
		<arg1>[POCFISForumV2].[dbo].[Forums]</arg1>
		<!-- Field to query -->
		<arg2>Forum</arg2>
		<!-- where clause - optional -->
		<arg3>where ForumId = 1</arg3>
		<!-- Optional 4th argument can be used to signify != comparison -->
		<!--<arg4>!=</arg4>-->
	</arguments>
</step>

Second Option: Specify the entire Select statement.
<step>
	<command>Sql Server Query</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<expectedValue>FAQ</expectedValue>
	<crucial>false</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<!-- Table to query or select statement -->
		<arg1>Select Forum from [POCFISForumV2].[dbo].[Forums] where ForumId = 2</arg1>
	</arguments>
</step>

Second Option Alternative type of SQL Select Statement: Specify the entire Select statement.
<step>
	<command>Sql Server Query</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<expectedValue>FAQ</expectedValue>
	<crucial>false</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<!-- Table to query or select statement -->
		<arg1>Select Top(1) Forum from [POCFISForumV2].[dbo].[Forums]</arg1>

═════════[ RETRIEVING JSON FROM AN API ENDPOINT  ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Get JSON command, like the SQL Server Connection, persists an object for use by subsequent commands.
Unlike the SQL Server Connection command, which opens a connection object, the Get JSON command
downloads and stores the JSON into a local variable that can later be used to SEARCH for key value pairs.
This local variable will contain the retrieved JSON until overwritten by a subsequent Get JSON request or 
until the test file executing ends.
Also, unlike the SQL Server Connection, which needs to be closed, there is no need to close the JSON object.
Each time a test is run, this variable is reset to null until populated by the Get JSON command.
The Get JSON command is used to retrieve the JSON from either the current page/url or a different page/url.
If the optional argument URL is not included, the current page/url will be used to retrieve the JSON.
If the URL is included as the command's optional sole argument, it will trigger a navigation event and then
that page/url will be used to retrieve the JSON.
The preferred way to perform the Get JSON is shown below and requires a previous navigation step.
This step should be conditional or crucial depending upon the subsequent steps in the test file.
In the example below, JSON is retrieved from the current URL and starts a Conditional Block so that
any query statements can be contained within the Conditional Block preventing their execution if this step fails.
<step>
	<!-- Allows you to retrieve JSON from the current end point.  
		Make this step crucial or conditional as subsequent steps depend on it's success. -->
	<command>Get JSON</command>
	<conditional>true</conditional>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<crucial>FALSE</crucial>
</step>

Alternatively, navigation can be included in the same step to first trigger a navigation event and then get the JSON.
The only difference between the example below and the one above is that the below example first triggers a navigation event
by including the URL as an argument in the test step.
<step>
	<!-- Allows you to retrieve JSON from a different end point.
		 Make this step crucial or conditional as subsequent steps depend on it's success.  -->

═════════[ QUERYING JSON FROM AN API ENDPOINT ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
A QUICK NOTE ABOUT JSON BEFORE REVIEWING THIS COMMAND
	Returned JSON is a string so numbers are represented without quotation marks while strings
	are represented with quotation marks.
	This means that 1 and "1" are not the same, as the former is a number and the latter is a string representation of that number.
	JSON files are key value pairs where the key is a string and the value is either a number or a string.
	The Key is like a variable name that is used to reference the value it contains.
The Query JSON command is actually just a CASE SENSITIVE search and not a querying framework like the SQL Query command.
For this reason, the != operator is not supported for JSON Queries.
This test will find every Key bearing the name provided in the <accessor></accessor> element and display the 
total number of Keys along with the number of Keys that matched or explain that no Keys matched.
The key, which is placed into the <accessor></accessor> node along with the expected value which is placed into the
<expectedValue></expectedValue> node are both case sensitive.
Additionally, the <expectedValue></expectedValue> node must represent the expected value exactly, so include quotes for
strings and exclude quotes for numbers.
To best determine how to represent the expected value, just copy the text between the colon and the end of the 
line excluding the comma, if present.
For the following examples, refer to the following JSON excerpt:
{
"ForumId": 1,
"Forum": "General",
"IsActive": true
}

For the first example, the Query JSON command is being used to find the ForumId value with a numeric value of 1.
Notice that the <expectedValue></expectedValue> contains 1 and not "1".
<step>
	<command>Query JSON</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<crucial>FALSE</crucial>
	<accessor>ForumId</accessor>
	<accessorType>JSON</accessorType>
	<expectedValue>1</expectedValue>
</step>

For the second example, the Query JSON command is being used to find the Forum value with a string value of "General".
When searching for string values the quotation marks must be used exactly as they are in the JSON returned.
Notice that the <expectedValue></expectedValue> contains "General" and not General.
<step>
	<command>Query JSON</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>

═════════[ SAVE JSON TO FILE  ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Save JSON command saves the JSON retrieved with the Get JSON command to the path provided.
Having the downloaded JSON on hand when testing is important for showing proof when providing feedback.
The command is a read actionType and not a write actionType as it has to read the JSON before writing it.
There are two arguments that can be used with this command.
The first argument is the file path and name where the JSON should be saved and is required.
The second argument is for overwriting the existing file.
If set to True or Overwrite, an existing file with the same name will be overwritten.
If set to False, which is the default, and a file exists with the same name, the application will append an incremental integer value 
to the file name and retest until it finds a file name that does not exist. 
The updated name will be used to name the downloaded JSON file and will be reported back via the console and log.
If the second parameter is missing, the value will be defaulted to false.
In the example below, the JSON previously retrieved will be saved to the file outlined in <arg1></arg1>,
but since <arg2></arg2> overwrite is set to false, if that file exists a new name will be created.
A message indicating that the file existed along with the original file name and the updated file name will be
reported to the tester via the console and will also be included in the log file.
<step>

</step>

In the below example, <arg2></arg2> has been set to true for overwrite, which will delete an existing file with 
the same name before saving the file.

═════════[ RETRIEVING XML FROM AN API ENDPOINT  ]══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Get XML command works like the Get JSON command persisting an object for use by subsequent commands.
The Get XML command downloads and stores the XML into a local variable that can later be used to SEARCH for elements containing text.
This local variable will contain the retrieved XML until overwritten by a subsequent Get XML request or 
until the test file executing ends.
Like the JSON object, there is no need to close the XML object.
Each time a test is run this variable is reset to null until populated by the Get XML command.
The Get XML command is used to retrieve the XML from either the current page/url or a different page/url.
If the optional argument URL is not included, the current page/url will be used to retrieve the XML.
If the URL is included as the command's optional sole argument, it will trigger a navigation event and then
that page/url will be used to retrieve the XML.
The preferred way to perform the Get XML is shown below and requires a previous navigation step.
This step should be conditional or crucial depending upon the subsequent steps in the test file.

═════════[ QUERYING XML FROM AN API ENDPOINT ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
A QUICK NOTE ABOUT XML BEFORE REVIEWING THIS COMMAND
	Returned XML is a string, but unlike JSON, it is unnecessary to differentiate between strings and numbers in your test.
	While XML does allow for adding attributes to distinguish between different value types, for the purposes of this tool .
	that is unnecessary to identify the type but attributes must be included as part of the <accessor></accessor> if they are
	part of the Element/Node tag.
	The Element/Node is like a variable that references the value it contains.
	If the Element being queried contains parameters, they must be included as part of the <accessor></accessor>.
	This application is going to place angle brackets around the accessor provided and search for that complete element from angle bracket
	to angle bracket.
	For example the XML Element:
		<ForumId type="int">1</ForumId>
	Should have the following accessor:
		<accessor>ForumId type="int"</accessor>

The Query XML command is actually just a CASE SENSITIVE search and not a querying framework like the SQL Query command.
For this reason, the != operator is not supported for XML Queries.
This test will find every Element/Node bearing the name provided in the <accessor></accessor> element and display the 
total number of Elements/Nodes along with the number of Elements/Nodes that matched or explain that no Elements/Nodes matched.
The Element/Node, which is placed into the <accessor></accessor> node along with the expected value, which is placed into the
<expectedValue></expectedValue> node are both case sensitive.
To best determine how to represent the expected value, just copy the text between the Element tags 
which most often will not include quotation marks.
For the following examples, refer to the following JSON excerpt:
<Forums>
	<ForumId>1</ForumId>
	<Forum>General</Forum>
	<Description>General Discussion Forum</Description>
</Forums>

For the first example, the Query XML command is being used to find the ForumId Element/Node with a value of 1.
Notice that unlike with JSON, there is no differentiation between strings and numbers and therefore no need for 
quotes in the <expectedValue></expectedValue>.
<step>
	<command>Query XML</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<crucial>FALSE</crucial>
	<accessor>ForumId</accessor>
	<accessorType>XML</accessorType>
	<expectedValue>1</expectedValue>
</step>

For the second example, the Query XML command is being used to find the Forum value with a string value of General.
Although this is actually querying the same endpoint as the JSON examples but with different URL parameters,
notice that the <expectedValue></expectedValue> is like any other non-JSON test and contains no quotation marks.
<step>
	<command>Query XML</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<crucial>FALSE</crucial>
	<accessor>Forum</accessor>
	<accessorType>XML</accessorType>
	<expectedValue>General</expectedValue>
</step>

For the following examples, refer to the following XML excerpt:
<Forums>
	<ForumId type="int">1</ForumId>
	<Forum>General</Forum>
	<Description>General Discussion Forum</Description>
</Forums>

For this example, the Query XML command is being used to find the ForumId Element/Node with a value of 1 but this Element/Node contains 
a type attribute.
Notice that this attribute MUST be accounted for in the <accessor></accessor>, as shown below, for the application to recognize this as the 
correct Element/Node.
Failing to include existing parameters when querying the XML will result in a failure to find the Element/Node and thus a test step failure. 
<step>
	<command>Query XML</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<crucial>FALSE</crucial>
	<accessor>ForumId type="int"</accessor>
	<accessorType>XML</accessorType>

═════════[ CHECK COLOR CONTRAST  ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Check Contrast command compares the forecolor brightness with the backcolor brightness and the color difference between the two.
Check contrast uses the formula found on the following page to calculate and compare the foreground and background brightness and color differences:
https://www.w3.org/TR/AERT/#color-contrast

When testing a page, one of the most important things to determine is if the color contrast is within acceptable ranges.
Good contrast allows users to easily read information without struggling to discern text from background.
A site with bad contrast is less likely to maintain interest and even less likely to receive repeat visits.
If the background color cannot be found on the container element acting as the background, this method climbs the
container's ancestral hierarchy until it finds the color used for the background.
In the results if you see ^1 it means that it had to use the parent's backcolor, ^2 is grandparent, ^3 great grand parent etc...
If you don't see the ^ sign, the value was taken directly from the element itself.
In the partial output example shown below, notice the ^2 following the backcolor listing, this indicates
that the grandparent of the container element was used as the source for the element's background color.
backcolor(rgba(248, 249, 250, 1))^2 Back-Color Brightness: 248.0

The first argument is the element type that you want to check.
It is suggested that you create focused tests targeting the lowest element that actually contains text instead of it's
parent element, which will contain that element thus also containing that element's text.
It is best to use p for <p> tags, label for <label> tags, span for <span> tags
With that said, it is possible to use an asterisk(*) to target all elements.
	-Note that doing so will take a long long time to complete and the results will likely be too much for the terminal display.
	-At the time of writing this, a test using an asterisk ran for over 2 hours for one page and was stopped having tested 
	-	only a fraction of the page!!!
It is suggested that you never use the overriding arguments but they were included to allow for slightly relaxed requirements.
The default brightness contrast which can be overridden in the second argument is 125.
The default color contrast which can be overridden in the third argument is 500.
In the following Check Contrast Test step, the tags being checked are all <p> tags against their container elements.
<step>
	<command>check contrast</command>
	<actionType>read</actionType>
	<crucial>FALSE</crucial>
	<arguments>
		<!-- Type of tag(s) to check contrast on -->
		<arg1>p</arg1>
		<!--  [Optional and not recommended] Allows Overriding Acceptable Contrast settings b for color brightness default is (125)-->
		<arg2>b=86</arg2>
		<!-- [Optional and not recommended] Allows Overriding Acceptable Contrast settings d for color difference default is (500) -->
		<arg3>d=450</arg3>

═════════[ COMPARE IMAGES AND CREATE DIFFERENCE IMAGE  ]═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Compare Images command, uses ImageMagick to compares 2 images on your local system and creates a difference image
outlining all things that differ between the images whether it is spacing, item dimensions, fonts, colors or anything
else that is not pixel exact.
The difference image can be used to quickly see all differences and use it to provide feedback to other teams.
This command also provides a numeric Pixel percentage of difference between the two images.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When running the Application from the command line, the DB Level from the ImageMagick compare utility
is automatically output as part of the compare operation, so this output is followed in the display by the 
following application message to describe what it means:
"- ImageMagick DB Level (0 for identical images, non-zero numeric value for non-identical images)"
This DB Level is an output from the ImageMagick compare application, not this application and therefore is not written to the log.
When running ImageMagick from within the IDE only the last DB Level is reported and it is reported at the end of execution.
When writing to the log for both standalone and Junit executions, this value is not accessible and, therefore, not written.
If the images are exactly the same, the percentage of difference will be 0.0 and will be displayed in green to 
indicate that the images are identical.
If the images are not exactly the same, the percentage of difference will be more than 0.0 and will be displayed in red
to indicate that there are differences between the images.
It is suggested that you create the following three folders when comparing images: Baseline, Actual, Difference
	The Baseline folder - This is where your comp image should be stored and images within this folder act as the
		base line images that the actual images should match.
		This image must exist in the file system!
	The Actual folder - This is where your captured screenshots can be saved to compare against the Baseline folder images.
		Having the images separated avoids confusion and allows for saving over previously saved actual images for continued comparisons.
		This image must exist in the file system!
	The Difference folder - This is where your difference images can be stored, separated from other images to allow for quickly 
		reviewing the differences.
		This image will be created in the file system and need not exist prior to running the test.
	The arguments for this command are as follows:
	<arg1>This argument specifies the baseline or comp image and is required.  The path and file must exist!</arg1>
	<arg2>This argument specifies the actual image being compared to the baseline image and is required. The path and file must exist!</arg2>
	<arg3>This argument specifies the difference file that will be created.  
		The path must exist but the file need not exist as it will be created.</arg3>
	<arg4>This argument allows for a global backup of the difference file to be created with a unique name based on the file name provided.</arg4>
		If this filename exists an incremental integer value will be appended to the base filename to create a unique file name, 
		which will be displayed to the tester and written to the log file for that test run.
		Keeping these files allows for tracking progress and determining differences between test runs.
		It also allows for comparing difference files, if desired but please note that storing a large number of files
		may adversely affect computer performance and even overrun free drive space, so monitoring the computer is essential when
		repeatedly running tests that create images and global backups.
	<arg5>This optional argument, is a double and allows for entering an acceptable decimal percentage of difference value.
		The default value for this, if missing, is 0 so any difference no matter how small cause this step to be marked as Failed.
		If the actual difference exceeds this value, the test step will be marked as Failed, but if the difference does not exceed this value  
		 this test step will be marked as Successful.
		It should be noted that it is strongly recommended that this value be omitted to ensure that any differences are brought to your attention.
IMPORTANT!!! If tests are rerun, difference images will be overwritten!!
Take time to backup needed difference images prior to rerunning tests or the previous difference image state will be lost.
The following command compares the baseline image in <arg1></arg1> with the actual image in <arg2></arg2> and 
creates the difference image <arg3></arg3> where specified.
Additionally, this command reports the numeric pixel percentage of difference for a quick reference so that the tester can identify
which images need further examination to detail the differences to the corresponding team members.

═════════[ PARSE AND CALCULATE DOUBLE  ]═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Parse and Compare Double command retrieves the text from a single field containing an equation, 
parses that field based on the delimiter passed in, sets the first number, operator and second number 
and performs a double calculation, which can be addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.
The calculation is simple allowing for 2 number calculations like 1.0 + 1.0 = and it will return 2.0. 
All arguments are required. 
TAKE NOTE: that the field holding the equation and the field where the answer will be placed must use 
the same <accessorType></accessorType>. 
So if accessing by ID, both fields will be accessed by ID and the same goes for xPath, CssSelector, ClassName and TagName accessors.
	The arguments for this command are as follows:
	<arg1>This argument specifies the delimiter.  A single space, without quotes, can be used to designate a space as the delimiter.</arg1>

The following command retrieves the text pointed to by the ID accessor in the format of  "5 + 1 = "
It them splits the string using the space delimiter shown in <arg1></arg1> to separate the text as follows:
value[0] = "5", value[1] = "+", value[2] = "1", value[3] = "="
The first number has the index of 0 as shown in <arg2></arg2>, the second number has the index of 2 as shown in <arg3></arg3>
and the operator has the index of 1 as shown in <arg4></arg4>, with all of the fields set for the equation, the answer is set 
to be sent to the element shown in <arg5></arg5>, and it will use the ID accessor, as was used when retrieving the field text initially.
First, the string representation of the number is converted to a double, which adds the decimal portion to the number if not already 
in decimal format, prior to performing the calculation.

═════════[ PARSE AND CALCULATE LONG  ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The Parse and Compare Long command retrieves the text from a single field containing an equation, 
parses that field based on the delimiter passed in, sets the first number, operator and second number 
and performs a double calculation, which can be addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.
The calculation is simple allowing for 2 number calculations like 1 + 1 = and it will return 2. 
All arguments are required. 
TAKE NOTE: that the field holding the equation and the field where the answer will be placed must use the same <accessorType></accessorType>. 
So if accessing by ID, both fields will be accessed by ID and the same goes for xPath, CssSelector, ClassName and TagName accessors.
	The arguments for this command are as follows:
	<arg1>This argument specifies the delimiter.  A single space, without quotes, can be used to designate a space as the delimiter.</arg1>
	<arg2>This argument specifies the index of the first number in the equation.</arg2>
	<arg3>This argument specifies the index of the second number in the equation.</arg3>
	<arg4>This argument specifies the index of the operator in the equation.</arg4>
	<arg5>This argument specifies the form field where this value should be written or can be set to persist to persist the value
		 for later use.</arg5>
The following command retrieves the text pointed to by the ID accessor in the format of  "5 + 1 = "
It them splits the string using the space delimiter shown in <arg1></arg1> to separate the text as follows:
value[0] = "5", value[1] = "+", value[2] = "1", value[3] = "="
The first number has the index of 0 as shown in <arg2></arg2>, the second number has the index of 2 as shown in <arg3></arg3>
and the operator has the index of 1 as shown in <arg4></arg4>, with all of the fields set for the equation, the answer is set 
The first number has the index of 0 as shown in <arg2></arg2>, the second number has the index of 2 as shown in <arg3></arg3>
and the operator has the index of 1 as shown in <arg4></arg4>, with all of the fields set for the equation, the answer is set 
to be persisted by using the persist keyword in <arg5></arg5>
First, the string representation of the number is converted to a long, which is a long integer, before the calculation is performed.
It should be noted that attempting to retrieve decimal formatted numbers with this will truncate the decimal portion of the value.
This truncation is purposely done in code to prevent the Java conversion error that would occur if this conversion were attempted.

═════════[ DRIVER ISSUES ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
If you run the application and the browser briefly opens and then closes:
Check you local browser version and compare that with the corresponding web driver for that browser.
If these are not the same, upgrade the web driver for this browser and it should work.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═════════[ URL VALIDATION FAILURE ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
When you enter a url into your web browser although the trailing slash may be there or may not be there, the returned URL from the test app differs.
Update your test to reflect what the test app is returning as this is the actual URL for this page.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═════════[ MISSING CONFIGURATION FILE ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
If you are running in JUnit and see the following message:
 the config file is not in the correct location or has the wrong name.
Configuration File not found! (Config/ConfigurationSetup.xml)
Place the configuration file in the location above with the name specified and re-run the test.
Exiting!!!
configSettings is null!!!
Although the reported error seems self explanatory, this means that the configuration file is not where
the application expects it to be, so place it into the correct location, specified in the error message, and re-run the test.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═════════[ UNEXPECTED OUTPUT FROM A TEST STEP ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
If you have an unexpected output or outcome of a test step, check the Action/Expected value field in your test 
and ensure that there is no keyword in there that the application may attempt to execute instead of the action intended.
The test will have to be re-written to account for this.
A specific SendKeys keyword was added to send text that could be misconstrued because it contains keywords.
While this particular solution may not be the one you need, there is likely a solution but if not, please document the issue 
so that it can be addressed in future implementations.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═════════[ OVERALL TEST RESULT SHOWS FAILURE ALTHOUGH TEST STEPS PASS (LAST TEST STEP PASSED) ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
When running tests, if a step marked as crucial does not fail, the overall JUnit test should 
show as having passed.
If the last step passes but the overall JUnit test shows a failure and the error doesn't point to 
anything in the test steps, re-run the test and it will likely show as having passed.
This intermittent failure was noticed during testing and while it is believed to have been a race condition
that was fixed, this has been added, as the exact cause has not been identified.
If during testing, this no longer occurs, this tip may be removed.

═════════[ XML DOCUMENT MUST START WITH AND END WITH THE SAME ELEMENT ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
This means that the start and end element are not proper opening and closing XML tags.
1.	First, ensure that the document has the start and end tags.
2.	Next, check that the end tag contains a </ as the first two characters as a common mistake is 
		copying and pasting and forgetting to update.
3.	Finally, check that the spelling, if this was not a copy paste issue, as it may have been a typo.

═════════[ CONTEXT MENU TAB SWITCHING IS FAILING ]═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
If a test is running that accesses the context menu or switches tabs, the MOUSE and KEYBOARD CANNOT BE USED
WHILE THE TEST IS IN PROGRESS or it will change the context and thus cause the test step to fail, which may in turn
cause subsequent test steps to fail.
Keep hands off mouse and keyboard while running context menu and tab switching tests and when possible, when running any other type of test.

An additional consideration is the time it takes for the tab to open. 
Be sure to place a wait step between the opening of a new tab and the Switch to Tab command to allow for the tab to load.
Attempting to switch to a tab before the tab loads will cause improper reporting the the number of open tabs to the application 
causing the Switch to Tab command to fail.
While the wait doesn't have to be long it needs to be long enough for the tab to register in the number of reported tabs for this to work.
If performing these steps separately continues to be an issue, try extending the wait time or adding the switch to tab argument to the 
context menu command that opens the new tab.

═════════[ SCREENSHOTS SAVING TO CONFIG FOLDER INSTEAD OF CONFIGURATION FILE SETTING  ]════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
If a <screenShotSaveFolder></screenShotSaveFolder> setting was added to the configuration file but
the screenshots are not being saved there, check that the entire specified folder structure exists!!!
The most likely cause of this issue is that all or part of the path specified does not exist.
Copy the path from Windows Explorer or File Explorer and paste it into the  <screenShotSaveFolder></screenShotSaveFolder> setting.
